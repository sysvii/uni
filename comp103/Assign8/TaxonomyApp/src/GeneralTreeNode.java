/**
 * GeneralTreeNode represents a simple node in a tree. The node stores
 * references to children and a parent (the latter is null in the case of the
 * root node).
 * 
 * For the purposes of one technique for drawing on the screen, there is a
 * location field as well. This is purely for drawing purposes, and is not
 * directly related to the concept of the tree structure. NOTE: There are other
 * techniques for drawing the tree that don't require the location field, so you
 * may decide not to use the location field/methods at all.
